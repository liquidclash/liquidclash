# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-22

### Security

- Secure macOS filesystem listener modes with no-follow dirfd operations and reject writable listener parents.
- Expose Unix peer credentials and verify Windows named-pipe server identity for authenticated IPC consumers.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-24

### Performance

- Improve IPC HTTP connection reuse by keeping pool permits attached to idle connections and reusing them when a pooled stream is checked out again.
- Reduce per-request work for PUT-heavy paths by allowing pre-serialized JSON bodies to be sent directly and by reusing those serialized bodies in batched PUT requests.
- Expand the benchmark suite to cover request construction, in-memory duplex roundtrips, server-side request pipeline handling, and batch request preparation.

### Changed

- Tighten default IPC server settings by reducing default connection limits and shortening the default read/write timeouts for both HTTP and stream servers.
- Add `max_requests_per_connection` to `ServerConfig` and close HTTP connections after the configured number of served requests to avoid overly long-lived sessions.
- Update the stream client request path so custom headers are forwarded consistently through the streaming request builder.
- Switch Criterion async benchmarking to Tokio and require the `full` feature set for the benchmark target.

### Fixed

- Invalidate broken pooled HTTP connections on request failures so they are dropped instead of being returned to the pool for reuse.
- Correct pool statistics reporting so total connection counts include both idle and checked-out connections.
- Clean up example client lifetimes and release timing so example binaries satisfy stricter Clippy checks around significant drops.
- Resolve documentation spell-check issues in source comments and changelog text.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- Move connection permit acquisition ahead of `accept()` in both `IpcHttpServer` and `IpcStreamServer` so excess socket connection attempts do not first consume process file descriptors.
- Reduce temporary work in `HttpIpcCodec` by parsing request headers once instead of parsing the full request again, lowering per-request allocation and CPU overhead.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-01-18

### Performance

- Refactored `IpcHttpServer` to use `tokio_util::codec::Framed`, removing manual `BufReader` loops.
- Implemented `HttpIpcCodec` for efficient HTTP-over-IPC protocol handling.
- Replaced `Arc<RwLock<ServerStats>>` with `Arc<SharedStats>` using atomic counters (`AtomicU64`) to eliminate lock contention during request handling.
- Improve IPC HTTP client around 8% performance by using `Bytes` without extra copies.
- Reduce copying when parsing IPC HTTP requests (zero-copy slice of request body) and avoid oversized read buffers.
- `criterion` benchmark `ipc_http_version/version_once` improved by ~25% (machine/workload dependent).


## [0.3.5] - 2025-12-15

### Fixed
- Avoid large stack arrays in `ipc_http_server` by allocating HTTP header storage on the heap (fixes Clippy `large-stack-arrays`).
- Replace `.clone()` on `Arc<T>` with `Arc::clone(&...)` across tests and examples to satisfy Clippy `clone_on_ref_ptr`.
- Address explicit auto-deref and other small Clippy warnings in `ipc_http_server` and related modules.
- Improve benches/examples error handling to address `unwrap_used`/`expect_used` lints; where appropriate, replace `unwrap()` with `expect()` and add targeted `#[allow(...)]` for benign bench/example code.
- Minor example fixes (e.g., replace `vec!` with array in `examples/stream_server.rs`) and other cleanup.

### Changed
- Code hygiene and small refactors to satisfy clippy and improve robustness across tests, benches, and examples.

### Internal
- Updated examples and benches: `examples/stream_server.rs`, `examples/traffic_monitor.rs`, `examples/metrics_demo.rs`, `examples/concurrent_proxy_test.rs`, and `benches/bench_version.rs`.
- Re-ran `cargo clippy` and iterated until the workspace was clean of the reported lints.


## [0.3.4] - 2025-10-11

### Changed
- Retry behavior in IpcHttpClient now follows the configured `max_retries` and `base_delay` values exactly, removing the earlier enforced minimal.
